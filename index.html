  <h2><em>Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone</em>, by J.K. Rowling</h2>
  <p>This story is about a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own.</p>
  <p>He is summoned from his life as an unwanted child to become a student at Hogwarts, an English boarding school for wizards.</p>
  <p>There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies and help him discover the truth about his parents' mysterious deaths.</p>
  <h2><em>The Summer I turned Pretty </em>, by Jenny Han</h2>
  <p>As far as teenager Isabel Conklin is concerned, summer is the only season that matters. For Isabel, nicknamed “Belly,” winter and spring are merely waiting periods. Not only is her birthday in August, but each June, she, her mother, Laurel, and her brother, Steven, travel to Cousins Beach to spend three months with the Fisher family, at their beach house on the Atlantic Coast.  </p>
  <p> Laurel Conklin and Susannah Fisher have been best friends since childhood, and now spend summers together with their children. Susannah has two teenage sons: Conrad, the eldest, is about to attend his freshman year of college, and Jeremiah is still in high school. The Fisher boys have been a source of friendship and fascination for Belly for as long as she can remember, and she’s been harboring a crush on Conrad for years. Both families have faced challenges; Susannah had cancer, and the Conklins recently divorced. </p>
  <h2><em>Of Mice And Men</em>, by John Steinbeck</h2>
  <p>Two migrant workers, George and Lennie,have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with “sharp, strong features.” Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a “shapeless” face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has an intellectual disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. </p>
  <p>George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. George angrily throws it away, fearing that Lennie might catch a disease from the dead animal. George complains loudly that his life would be easier without having to care for Lennie, but the reader senses that their friendship and devotion is mutual. </p>
